3b Pseudocode and Coding
Your sister-in-law has decided to give all of the employees in her small company a 6% raise. A novice programmer, she wants to create a program that calculates the new wages. She has created the following pseudocode and has asked you to look it over for errors.

Display “Enter old wage: “
Read Old_wage

New_wage = Old_wage * .06

Display Old_wage
Display “+ 6% = “
Display New_wage

Implement the corrected pseudocode in C++.

Assume no leap years (i.e., ALL years are 365).
Assume the age on the day before your last birthday (i.e., no partial years).

Be sure to START with writing your pseudocode, then write your code.
