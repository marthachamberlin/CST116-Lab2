Module 2: Lab 2


Legal Literals & Statements
In the following literals, correct any that are illegal for C++. For all of them, state what type of literal it is (in its corrected form, if necessary).
1. -12.34
2. 'Hello'
3. "F"
4. "1234"
5. '1'
6. A
7. " Marcus'


Submit: labelled and corrected literals


For each of the following statements, correct them to make them legal C++ statements (if necessary).
1. int a, int b;
2. int a = b; int b = 0;
3. int a = 0, b = 3.5;
4. char grade = "A";
5. char c = 1;
6. int a, b, c, d, e, f;
7. char x = “This is a test.”;


Submit: corrected statements


For each of the following statements, correct them to make them legal C++ statements (if necessary).
1. y= 5x + 1;
2. x2 + 2x + 1 = 0;
3. x= 5 * A + 4;
4. 0 = -15 * b;


Submit: corrected statements

3b Pseudocode and Coding
Your sister-in-law has decided to give all of the employees in her small company a 6% raise. A novice programmer, she wants to create a program that calculates the new wages. She has created the following pseudocode and has asked you to look it over for errors.


Display “Enter old wage: “
Read Old_wage


New_wage = Old_wage * .06


Display Old_wage
Display “+ 6% = “
Display New_wage


Implement the corrected pseudocode in C++.

3c Pseudocode and Coding
Write a C++ program to calculate how old you are in days. 
* Declare an integer variable and initialize it to your age.
* Declare a constant that represents the number of days in a year (365).
* Assume no leap years (i.e., ALL years are 365).
* Assume the age on the day before your last birthday (i.e., no partial years).


Be sure to START with writing your pseudocode, then write your code.
